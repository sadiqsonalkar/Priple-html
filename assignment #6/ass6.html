	<h3 >INGREDIENTS</h3>

	<ul id="ul1" >
		<li>2 large mangoes , ripe and juicy - to make 2 cups puree</li>
		<li>395 g / 14 oz sweetened condensed milk </li>
		<li> cups thickened cream / heavy cream / whipping cream , cold</li>
		<li>1/8 tsp yellow liquid food colouring (optional) (Note 5)

	<H4 >STEPS TO FOLLOW</H4>
	<ol id="ol1" >
		<li>
			Beat cream with a hand held beater or stand mixer until stiff peaks form 
		</li>
		<li>
			Take a scoop of cream and put it in the mango mixture. Fold through until mostly combined - lumps is fine (this is just to lighten it up a bit).

		</li>
		<li>
			Then pour the mango mixture into the cream. Fold through (see video) rather than mixing vigorously like you would cake batter, until lump free. This will take a few minutes.

		</li>
		<li>
			Pour into a container (preferably with a lid). I recommend glass, if you can, or other non reactive container.

		</li>
		<li>
			Place a piece of baking / parchment paper on the surface. Then place lid on or using cling wrap.
Freeze for 12+ hours.
		</li>
		<li>
			Remove parchment paper. Stand for 5 minutes to soften slightly, then scoop and serve!
		</li>
		<li>If frozen for 24 hours or longer, it will need a couple of extra minutes to soften to a scoop able consistency</li>
